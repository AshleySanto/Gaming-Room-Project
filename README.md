# Gaming Room Project

**_Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?_**

The Gaming Room is a mobile application company known for its current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently only available to Android users. They want to expand their user base by developing a new web-based application across multiple platforms based on their current game.

**_What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?_**

I think providing my recommendations based on my evaluation is what I did particularly well. I was able to give recommendations based on which OS platform they should develop on, the architectures they can use, which storage and memory management they should consider, the distributed systems and networks, and lastly, the security it offers.

**_What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?_**

I think the process of working through a design document is helpful because it gives you a more concrete visual of what the client is looking for. For instance, the executive summary and design constraints tell us who the company is and what it is they are hoping to achieve with our assistance. The UML diagram gives us a comprehensive visual of how the program should be written.

**_If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?_**

I would choose to revise the Evaluation section. I think I gave very general reasoning for each operating system, which is fine but it could have been a bit deeper in explaining certain aspects. I just really struggled with this section of how to get my thoughts written out based on what I was reading. 

**_How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?_**

It's important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are the ones who will be using the application. Their opinions of the application are the most important as they are the main determination if an app will be successful or not. The user's needs were implemented into the software design by making sure the usability of the app was there where the app ran as intended and didn't cause any issues. Apps released with bugs would be a major issue among users and may cause them to stop playing.

**_How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?_**

I think I would use a similar strategy to what we did here should I work on something similar in the future. Having that general documentation helps us know what the client is looking for and the issues that have been brought to our attention. The domain model was also extremely helpful in visualizing how the software should be written and developed.
